# Quantifying-the-Invasive-Metabolome
Repository of Code used to generate results seen in Quantifying the Invasive Metabolome on BioRXIV.

The aim of this project was to collect the chemical profiles of invasive/non-native and non-invasive/native populations of plants that are known invasive species. 
Chemical profiles were compared using unsupervised machine learning approaches and statistical analysis, being compared in terms of composition, chemical structure similarity 
and compound production rates. 
Invasive/Non-Native profiles were also correlated according to environmental and ecological factors.

See RDS and Excel files for data used.
